# Project: Airbnb Clone using React Native
- So we are building Airbnb Clone in React Native.
- I am studying this tutorial by **cubui**

- My system:
    - Windows 10
    - react-native-cli: 2.0.1
    - react-native: 0.57.5

- Creating a new application from CLI:
    - **react-native init AirbnbClone**
    - For more basics:

## Git log out user from command line - Windows 10
I came across this same problem, and the above answer didn't work for me because github was being fed my credentials through windows credential manager instead of git bash.

You may have to check windows credential manager and delete the github entry under **control panel > user accounts > credential manager > Windows credentials > Generic credentials**
